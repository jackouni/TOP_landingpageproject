# TOP_landingpageproject
This is my first landing page. A project that I am taking on within the Odin Project.

The goal here is to use a common website template provided by TOP (The Odin Project) while adding my own personality, style and twists to it. Here I can showcase my current skills I've learned from TOP up till this point which include: html and css basics; using flexbox to dictate grow and shrink rates of items and structure my website's content; using Git to create repos, new files and use with GitHub to create remote repositories; use of VS Code to create clean, readable and easy to understand for other collaborators to contribute or modify for themselves; and lastly, the process itself of learning how-to learn.

 My goal starting out is to create a "meme" website that features business dressed dogs as the main content.
A problem I may find with this idea is locating images that I can use with a free-use license.

Hoping to update my learnings and progress from here on...
